    problemDescription: "Find the vertical asymptote(s) of the following function:",
    problem: "f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-2}",
    solution: `<ol>
        <li>Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero and the numerator is non-zero</li>
        <li>Set x-2 = 0 and solve for x</li>
        <li>x = 2</li>
        <li>Check that the numerator is non-zero at x = 2 (it is 1, which is non-zero)</li>
        <li>Therefore, there is a vertical asymptote at x = 2</li>
    </ol>`,
    answer: "x = 2"
